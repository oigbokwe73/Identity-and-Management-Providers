- **ID.me**: Ideal for government portals needing secure, **compliant identity verification**. The chicklet for ID.me is usually placed on **U.S. government websites** that require robust identity proofing (e.g., VA, IRS).
  
- **Alabama Medicaid IDP**: Designed for **state-specific services**, such as Alabama Medicaid. The chicklet is used in secure portals where **citizens verify identity** to access healthcare benefits.

- **Azure AD B2C**: Highly flexible and customizable for **global businesses**. E-commerce platforms or consumer-facing apps can offer multiple login options, such as **Google, Facebook, or Microsoft accounts**, using Azure AD B2C's chicklets.

Each IDP has its unique set of use cases, and chicklets provide an easy-to-use, recognizable interface for users to authenticate via their preferred method.
