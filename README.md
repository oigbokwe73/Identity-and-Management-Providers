 ### Use Case with Chicklets for Each IDP (ID.me, Alabama Medicaid IDP, Azure AD B2C)

Chicklets are commonly used as clickable buttons representing different identity providers (IDPs) on login pages. Below are specific use cases and chicklet examples for each IDP—**ID.me**, **Alabama Medicaid IDP**, and **Azure AD B2C**—illustrating how they might be integrated into different applications.

---

### **Use Case 1: ID.me - U.S. Government Service Portal**

#### **Scenario:**
A U.S. citizen logs into the **Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)** website to access healthcare benefits. The VA website provides a **Login with ID.me** option for secure identity verification.

#### **Chicklet Example:**

```html
<a href="https://api.id.me/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=openid email profile">
    <img src="https://www.id.me/assets/images/buttons/IDme-button.png" alt="Login with ID.me" />
</a>
```

#### **Workflow:**
1. **User Clicks Chicklet**: User clicks the "Login with ID.me" chicklet on the VA website.
2. **Redirect to ID.me**: The user is redirected to ID.me for identity verification (OAuth 2.0 flow).
3. **Identity Verification**: ID.me prompts the user to log in, upload ID documents (driver’s license, passport), and complete biometric verification (selfie or face recognition).
4. **Token Exchange**: ID.me sends an authorization code back to the VA website.
5. **Access Granted**: The VA website exchanges the code for an access token, verifies the user’s identity, and grants access to healthcare benefits.

#### **Chicklet UI:**
The ID.me chicklet is commonly seen as a button with the **ID.me logo**:

### **Use Case 2: Alabama Medicaid IDP - Medicaid Benefits Portal**

#### **Scenario:**
An Alabama resident accesses the **Alabama Medicaid Portal** to verify their eligibility for Medicaid benefits. The portal uses the Alabama Medicaid IDP for secure identity verification.

#### **Chicklet Example:**

```html
<a href="https://medicaid.alabama.gov/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&scope=openid email profile">
    <img src="https://medicaid.alabama.gov/assets/images/buttons/Alabama-Medicaid-Login.png" alt="Login with Alabama Medicaid IDP" />
</a>
```

#### **Workflow:**
1. **User Clicks Chicklet**: The user clicks the “Login with Alabama Medicaid IDP” chicklet on the portal.
2. **Redirect to Alabama Medicaid IDP**: The user is redirected to the Alabama Medicaid IDP authentication page.
3. **Identity Proofing**: The user uploads their state-issued ID, performs biometric verification (selfie), and may answer additional identity verification questions.
4. **Token Exchange**: The Alabama Medicaid IDP sends an authorization code back to the Medicaid portal.
5. **Access to Benefits**: The portal exchanges the code for a token, verifies the user, and grants access to Medicaid benefits.

#### **Chicklet UI:**
This chicklet can feature **Alabama Medicaid branding**:

### **Use Case 3: Azure AD B2C - E-commerce Website Login**

#### **Scenario:**
A global e-commerce platform allows users to sign up and log in using **Azure AD B2C** with various identity providers, such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. Azure AD B2C manages the authentication flows.

#### **Chicklet Example:**

```html
<a href="https://login.your-app.com/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?p=b2c_1_signupsignin&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=id_token&scope=openid profile email">
    <img src="https://your-app.com/images/login-with-azure-ad-b2c.png" alt="Login with Azure AD B2C" />
</a>
```

#### **Workflow:**
1. **User Clicks Chicklet**: The user clicks the "Login with Azure AD B2C" chicklet on the e-commerce site.
2. **Redirect to Azure AD B2C**: The user is redirected to the Azure AD B2C authentication page.
3. **Choose Identity Provider**: The user selects their preferred identity provider (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.).
4. **Authentication**: The user logs in via their chosen provider (e.g., Google). Azure AD B2C handles the token exchange.
5. **Access Granted**: The e-commerce site receives an authentication token from Azure AD B2C and grants access to the user.

#### **Chicklet UI:**
Azure AD B2C can present **multiple identity provider options** (chicklets for Google, Facebook, etc.):

**Example:**

```html
<a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?p=b2c_1_google&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=id_token&scope=openid profile email">
    <img src="https://your-app.com/images/google-login.png" alt="Login with Google" />
</a>

<a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?p=b2c_1_facebook&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=id_token&scope=openid profile email">
    <img src="https://your-app.com/images/facebook-login.png" alt="Login with Facebook" />
</a>
```

Each identity provider, such as Google or Facebook, would have its own chicklet:
